# CPP Code Generation

This is a project utilizing libclang to auto-generate class functions that need to be implemented. The main purpose of this project was for me to get familiarized with libclang's library, and thus some better APIs and tools were not evaluated.

## How it works:

Say you have an example header file with definitions like Class.hpp:

```cpp
class MyClass
{
public:
  MyClass(); // <-- needs definition
  ~MyClass(); // <-- needs definition
  int field;
  void method(int x, float y); // <-- needs definition

  static const int static_field;
  int static_method(); // <-- needs definition
};
```

Call the program in such a way will generate the class implementations:
```cmd
./main testcases/Class.hpp
```

Output:

```cpp
// parsed from: testcases/Class.hpp
MyClass::void MyClass(){}

MyClass::void ~MyClass(){}

MyClass::void method(int x, float y){}

MyClass::int static_method(){}
```

And *Voila :)*, the implementations can be piped into a `Class.cpp` file.
You can even have multiple classes in one header file and their respective methods will be generated by the program.

## Known limitations:
My project is quite simple for learning purposes and will not do:
- Find out const/virtual/volatile qualifiers etc., would need a workaround possibly thorugh `clang_getCursorPrettyPrinted()` to get the full line
- nested classes are not yet tested, but may be supported

# Other tools for evaluation
There are simpler methods of achieving similar results, of which I have not yet evaluated, including:
- [TreeSitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) Which would allow queries into various language files to parse out relevant details. such as the class methods.
- [Cog](https://www.python.org/about/success/cog/) - a lightweight python code generator for C/C++. Less powerful but may get the job done for code generation.
